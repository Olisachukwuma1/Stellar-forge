    // extended on access ("Implement extend_ttl correctly per persistent

    // Two lookup helpers exist because entries written by factory binaries

    //
    // - `read_addr_keyed` is for pure view entrypoints: persistent first,
    //   falling back to the legacy `instance` copy if present, but never
    //   writing storage. Keeps read-only calls free of a write footprint.
    // - `migrate_addr_keyed` is for mutating entrypoints, which already pay
    //   for a write: it performs the same fallback lookup, but if the value
    //   is only found in legacy `instance` storage it copies it into
    //   `persistent` storage (extending its TTL) and removes the `instance`
    //   copy, so the next access — from either helper — is O(1) against the
    //   persistent entry alone.
    //
    // `TokenInfo` is additionally migrated in bulk by `migrate`'s schema-v3
